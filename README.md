Jermaine Tucker 03/21/2020   Blog Post Project 2   Purpose: To practice using Text elements.  Who: Jermaine Tucker    What: Completed the blog post coding project that dealt with coding his blog post in HTML.   When: Monday March 21th, 2020 9:08pm    Where: At Home    Why: The purpose of the assignment was to get familiar with the following aspects of HTML:  Structure, Text, Form   How: In order to complete this assignment, I researched the basic format of a web developer's resume and coded them into Codepen's text editor. I like using Codepen because it has separate text editors that allow you to organize your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code, and also because it has a visual interface that allows you to see how your code will look. Afterwards, I saved the code in Github in order to become more familiar with using GitHub--still learning by the way.  Elements Used:&lt;p>, &lt;dfn>, &lt;q>, &lt;h1>, &lt;h1>, &lt;h2>, &lt;h3>,&lt;body>,&lt;head>,&lt;title>,&lt;html>,&lt;header>,&lt;main>,&lt;footer>
